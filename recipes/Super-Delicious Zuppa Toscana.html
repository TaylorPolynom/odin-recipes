    <h2>Description</h2>


    <p>Zuppa Toscana means “Tuscan Soup” in Italian. However, the classic tuscan soup is usually made with veggies (like zucchini, celery, carrots), kale, potatoes, cannellini beans, tomato sauce, pancetta and toasted bread</p>
    <p>This soup is irresistible!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>

     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>
           <p>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.</p>
