     <ol>

        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</p>

        <li>
            <p>Stir confectioners' sugar and 3/4 cup apple cider together in a small bowl to make the glaze.</p>


        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour glaze over the cake and let soak into the cake and down the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a plate and cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p>
